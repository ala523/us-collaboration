# US-Collaboration

Hello Sir, how are you?

I would like to take jobs in upwork.com with my web dev skills and your call support together.

There are many cool clients in upwork but there are many world-wide developers and most of the clients are hiring US only developers.
So I couldn't take any projects in upwork.

So We will take jobs in upwork together and I do development on my computer and you will support me for call service only to take jobs.

## So I want to use your Upwork account to get jobs on your computer remotely via anydesk. You will help me get jobs in upwork. For example, call for help.
You will need to help me for an hour a day.

I will give 30% for your help. It will be a minimum of $2000 per month.

If you have a spare computer and are interested in, please contact me via Telegram.
